Almost three years ago I got pregnant. I was working at a textile factory nine hours per day. One day, my blood pressure was low, I was sweaty and feeling really sick so my boss sent me to the hospital. My pregnancy was a high-risk one; I got a medical license that stated I must spend most of my day in bed until my baby was born. 

Why am I saying this if we are supposed to be talking about testing?  Well, thing is that since I was 14 I love exploring how “computer stuff” works.  So one night my hubby saw me typing weird things on a black screen and asked what was it. It was just HTML with a bit of CSS that asked silly questions on the browser, collected the answers and keep on asking. Just for fun.  He immediately threw to me the words that would change my game:  Why aren’t you working on IT? 

I’ve never thought about it before. It was supposed to be a hobby: something to do for fun, to spend my time and to forget about everything for a while. Perfect timing, one of my Facebook connections made a post about [**Upwork**](https://www.upwork.com/). I had nothing to lose; in fact, I had a lot of time to spend on my laptop.  So I signed in as a Virtual Assistant since I’m Argentinian; my native language is Spanish and I am pretty fluent in English. That would give me money to pay for the courses I was planning to take and to buy a new laptop.  (Spoiler alert: it did!)

In July of 2018 I got a proposal named “Argentina: UX survey about search engines usability”. The company was [**Global App Testing**](https://www.globalapptesting.com/), and the person in contact with me was kind and clear about the project. Before they could hire me, I had to take an online test –that I must admit, at first made me nervous- and if I passed it I could join their crew.

That was my first job as a tester. But I didn’t fully understand what I was doing. I mean, for sure I was doing what I was asked to do, what I did not get was how huge the testing world is.
