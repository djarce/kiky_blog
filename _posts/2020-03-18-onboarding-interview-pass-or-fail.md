Taking an online test knowing that your job depends on it gives a lot of pressure. And I can tell you that it is even more stressful when the topic of the test is almost new to you. That's what happened when the opportunity to join [**Global App Testing**](https://www.globalapptesting.com/) was offered to me.

The instructions were pretty clear: I had to fill in my personal details, testing experience and the devices I could use to test. After that, I had to take an online assessment which tested my knowledge and understanding of QA testing as well as my quality of written English. I made some searches online to get to know a bit about it.

Answers gave from 0.25 to 0.75 if wrong and 1 to 2 points if right. I’ve got to get 14 points at the final score to be accepted. 
All the questions gravitated about how to write a bug report (duh!), so a severity assessment and a bug report example were included. Good to know, before answering the questions you’re presented with a notions page. That was a relief because you could check some points before taking the actual quiz. 

I think the whole process took about 20 minutes (Thanks for that!). After passing the test I received a welcome e-mail with extra -but important- info. Then, the first test cycle came in and I was SO happy that I can’t explain it. What I can say is that I still enjoy working as a tester.  :D
